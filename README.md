# data-visual-challenge (module 5)

I mainly reviewed the Assignments to formulate the code.  I did use the XLA to fix a few spots in the code. 

Exception to that are listed here,

I used EDX to get the duplicate function

I used EDX to review on how to remove mouse g989

I used a google search, to review how to rotate the xlabel on the bar chart (found the information on stack overflow)

I got tutoring help to get the first bar charts in descending order.  Also got help with the loop and the quartiles and fine tuning some of the visualizations.
